# Linear_Regression_Model_ML

## All you need is right here
I'm using the student-mat.csv data set here because it's what I used to learn, but this model can be applied to similar data-sets.
It's best to make sure why this model would work with your data first, before you go ahead and do anything to train it.
This is a very simple to learn process. 

## You can change File and Data variables
The file and data variables are the most important ones here, make sure they're set up properly (A.k.a the proper file and proper parameters within that file).
Furthermore, you should ###NOT comment out the 'for _ in range(30):' function unless you've trained your dataset and made a pickle file with it! 

## Good luck.
